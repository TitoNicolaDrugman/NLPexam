📱 "ADSM - (Almost) Detecting Spam Messagesr" - A Natural Language Processing Project 📬

I embarked on an intriguing journey into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with my project "ADSM - (Almost) Detecting Spam Messages" 🧠

🔸 Project Context:
The project involved working with the SMS Spam Collection, a dataset of 5,574 SMS messages in English, each tagged as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam." The dataset served as a valuable resource for SMS spam research, offering insights into identifying and distinguishing between legitimate and unwanted messages.

🔹 Dataset Description:
Each message in the dataset was structured with two columns:
1. "v1" - Contained the label (ham or spam).
2. "v2" - Contained the raw text of the SMS message.

This corpus was collated from a variety of sources, including:
➡️ A collection of 425 SMS spam messages from the Grumbletext website.
➡️ A subset of 3,375 randomly selected "ham" messages from the NUS SMS Corpus.
➡️ A list of 450 "ham" messages from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis.
➡️ The SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big, which consisted of 1,002 "ham" messages and 322 spam messages.

🔹 Project Objectives:
The primary objective of the "ADSM - (Almost) Detecting Spam Messages" project was to build a robust NLP model capable of classifying SMS messages as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam." This entailed natural language understanding, text classification, and the ability to identify unwanted messages.

🔸 NLP Approach:
To accomplish this, I designed and trained a natural language processing model that leveraged machine learning techniques to analyze and classify the content of SMS messages. This model was developed to be proficient in discerning the nuances of text data, making it adept at identifying spam messages and safeguarding users against unsolicited content.

This project expanded my knowledge of NLP, demonstrating the power of language processing in tackling real-world problems like spam detection.
